# Fibonacci
Two methods written to return `n` numbers of the Fibonacci sequence. One is written using regular iteration, the other using recursion

#### Parameters
(Number `n`)

#### Returns
Array containing the first `n` numbers of the Fibonacci sequence

## Problems
Write two methods that return `n` numbers of the Fibonacci sequence: one using iteration, the other using recursion

## What I used
Iterative loops, recursive methods

## What I learned
Basic recursion
